## Overview
This project is a biologically plausible **Spiking Neural Network (SNN)** simulation engine built entirely from scratch using **Python** and **NumPy**. It avoids high-level deep learning frameworks (like PyTorch or TensorFlow) to implement and analyze the core dynamics of **Third Generation Neural Networks** [1].

The primary goal is to solve classification tasks (MNIST) using **Reward-Modulated Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (R-STDP)**, avoiding standard backpropagation. This mimics the brain's "Three-Factor Learning Rule":
1.  **Pre-synaptic activity** (Input)
2.  **Post-synaptic activity** (Output)
3.  **Global Neuromodulation** (Reward/Dopamine signal)

## Theoretical Background
Unlike traditional ANNs (2nd Generation) that use continuous activation functions (Sigmoid/ReLU) and firing rates, this project utilizes **Spiking Neurons (3rd Generation)**. Information is encoded in the precise timing of single action potentials (spikes), which is computationally more powerful and biologically realistic [1].

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Core Logic:** NumPy (for linear algebra and vectorization)
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib (for raster plots and membrane potential traces)
